# LinearRegression-and-Regularization
Training and test scores from "Linear Model on make_wave DS.py" and "Regressin Model on Boston data set.py" simply
shows that we have overfitting and underfitting problems, in order to solve that problem we use different Linear regression
algorithms which contain regularization, those are Rigde and Lasso, "Ridge regression on boston DS.py" and
"Lasso regressin on boston DS.py" illustrates how to prevent fitting problems by modifying the given parameter "alpha".
